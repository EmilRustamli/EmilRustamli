### Hi there ğŸ‘‹, My name is Emil Rustamli
#### I'm Sophomore Student at Minerva University ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡· ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡¼ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡· ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª 
At Minerva, while mastering Data Science and Statistics & Economics majors, I am traveling to the 7 global tech hubs, to work on local problems with international partner companies in addition to discovering new cultures and becoming a global citizen.

In Taiwan, I am researching the behavior of social media usersÂ â€“ as Data Science Intern at the Taiwan Digital Diplomacy Association in partnership with Meta Taiwan â€“ talking about the Ukraine-Russia war to establish data-driven relations between Ukrainian social media users' behaviors and Ukraine's victory in the information war. The analysis of Twitter and Facebook posts via Natural Language Processing serves us to establish a handbook for Taiwanese Politicians to be more efficient Social Media Users and reach a global audience about the Taiwanese realities.

In South Korea, I worked on limiting political backsliding through an e-voting system based on BlockChain technology.

In addition to my Data Science Internship, I've been working as Finance Intern at Minerva University for over a year; in other words, I am the FinTech guy of Minervans.

I am looking forward to developing my practical experience in Data Science and Analytics fields by interning at Tech companies or Hedge Funds.

Skills: Python | SQL |  R | Tableau |
